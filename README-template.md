### Links

- Solution URL: [<a href="https://my-preview-card.vercel.app/">My Preview Card</a>
](https://my-preview-card.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

The biggest thing for me was proper naming of class names and not necessarily giving every single line of html a class.
Working one section at a time, if I work too many at once, I will get completely overwhelmed

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I need to get more comftorable with css styling and taking my time. Next I want to implement javascript and react into my projects to set myself up for the real world workplace.
